# üõí Product Management REST API

A simple RESTful web service for managing products, built with **Spring Boot**, **Java**, and **PostgreSQL**. The service provides endpoints to create and retrieve products, including automatic currency conversion using the Croatian National Bank (HNB) API.

## üìå Project Description

This application fulfills **Assignment #1: Spring REST API**, demonstrating the use of modern Spring ecosystem tools and design patterns. It includes:
- Product creation with price conversion from EUR to USD (via external HNB API).
- Product listing and lookup.
- Role-based endpoint security using Spring Security.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è There is **no frontend**; this is a pure backend REST API.

### üßæ Notes

- This collection includes only **basic test cases** for easier testing (e.g., successful requests, validation errors, duplicate checks).
- Some requests may need to be **adjusted to fit your local environment** (e.g., data persisted in DB, url, etc..).
- For advanced usage of Postman or to learn how to create your own requests, please refer to the [official Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/).
